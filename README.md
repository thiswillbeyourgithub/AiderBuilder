# AiderBuilder

In `./BUILDER.md` you can find a text for [aider.chat](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) that is supposed to help running aider in a loop.

In `./script.sh` you can have an idea of how to run this.

Also here's a handy alias:

```shell
alias aider_builder="aider --read ./path/to/AiderBuilder/BUILDER.md"
```
